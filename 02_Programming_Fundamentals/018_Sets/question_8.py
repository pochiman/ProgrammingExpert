# Write a program that continually asks the user to enter characters until the user enters a previously entered character 
# or more than one character at a time.  After, the program should print the number of unique characters that were entered.

# Use a set to accomplish this.

# You'll have to use the strings:
# "Enter a character: "
# "Number of unique characters entered: _"

characters = set()

while True:
    character = input("Enter a character: ")
    if len(character) > 1:
        break

    if character in characters:
        break

    characters.add(character)

print(f"Number of unique characters entered: {len(characters)}")
