# Key Terms

# [Int]
In Python, the `int` data type can represent all integers, positive or negative. 
`…, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, …` are all ints in Python.

# [Float] 
In Python, the `float` data type represents floating point numbers, positive or negative.
`-2.1, .2, 7., -90.234, 0.222321, 3.14` are all floats in Python. Even numbers like `2.0` that 
are whole numbers are considered floats because of the presence of the decimal point (the period).

# [String]
The `str` data type represents a sequence of characters. In Python, they start and end with `", ', """` or `'''`. 
The following are examples of valid Python strings: `"hello", "2.0", 'str', """False""", '''true'''`

# [Bool]
In Python, the `bool` data type represents one of two values: `True` or `False`.
