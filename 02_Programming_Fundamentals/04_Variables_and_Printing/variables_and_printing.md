# Key Term

# [Variable]
A variable can be thought of as a container that stores a value. As a programmer you can create 
your own variables that store different data types. The following is an example of a variable,

hello_world = "this variable holds a string"

In Python, variable names must:

 • Not start with a number.
 • Not contain any special characters other than underscores (_).
 • Not contain any spaces.
