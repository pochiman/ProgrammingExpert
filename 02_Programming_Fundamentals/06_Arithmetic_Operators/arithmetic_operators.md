both `2` and `3` are operands while `+ ` is the operator.

# [Integer_Division]
`Integer division` is division in which the fractional part (remainder) is discarded. 
In Python, integer division is performed by using the `//` operator. For example, the 
expression `11 // 3` evalualtes to `3`.

# [Modulus]
The `modulus` (or modulo) is the remainder after dividing one number by another. 
In Python, modulus is performed by using the % operator. For example, the expression 
`10 % 3` evaluates to `1`.

# [Concatenation]
In Python, `concatenation` is the process of combining or adding strings together. 
Concatenation can be performed using the `+` operator. For example, the expression 
`"1" + "word"` evaluates to `"1word"`.
