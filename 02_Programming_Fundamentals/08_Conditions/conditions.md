# Key Terms

# [Condition]
A `condition` is any expression that evaluates to `True` or `False`. 
The expression `2 == 2` evaluates to `True` and is considered a condition.

# [ASCII]
`ASCII` is the abbreviation for `American Standard Code for Information Interchange`. 
This code provides a standard character set for computers where each character on the 
keyboard is represented by a unique integer.

In Python, you can determine the ASCII code for a character by using the `ord()` function 
and determine the character represented by an integer with the `chr()` function. 
For example, `ord('a')` returns `97` and `chr(97)` returns `a`.
