# Key Term

# [if_/_elif_/_else]
When you want to conditionally run a part of your program (depending on the value 
of a variable, for example) `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements are necessary:

`if x == 1:`
    `print("If x is equal to 1, then this will be printed!")`
`elif x == 2:`
    `print("If x is equal to 2, then this will be printed!")`
`else:`
    `print("If x isn't equal to 1 or 2, then this will be printed!")`
