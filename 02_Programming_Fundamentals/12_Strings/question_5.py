# Write a program that uses a single print statement to output the following text:

'''
     *
    ***
   *****
  *******
   *****
    ***
     *
'''

# Note that:
##### You should not use a multi-line string.
##### Your output should not have any trailing spaces (invisible spaces after the * symbols on each line).
##### The middle line with 7 * symbols starts with 1 space.

print("    *\n   ***\n  *****\n *******\n  *****\n   ***\n    *")
