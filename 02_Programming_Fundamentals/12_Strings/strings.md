# Key Terms

# [String]
The `str` data type represents a sequence of characters. In Python, they start and end 
with `"`, `'`, `"""`, or `'''`. The following are examples of valid Python strings:
`"hello"`, `"2.0"`, `'str'`, `"""False"""`, `'''true'''`.

# [New_Line_Character_-_\n]
The `new line character` is a `\n`. This character is invisible when printed but tells 
the computer to move the cursor to the next line. For example, `print("hello\nworld\n!")` 
outputs the following:

`hello`
`world`
`!`
