# Key Term

# [Range]
The `range(start, stop, step)` function in Python creates an iterator that returns 
integers one by one from `start` (inclusive) to `stop` (exclusive), incrementing 
the last value by `step` every time.

The `range` function is commonly used with `for` loops, like so:

`for i in range(1, 11, 2):`
    `print(i)`

this loop will output the following:
1
3
5
7
9
