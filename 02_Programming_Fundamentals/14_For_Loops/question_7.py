# Use nested for loops to iterate through the provided list, which contains other 
# lists, and print the respective sums of the inner lists, each on a separate line.

# Provided List
lst = [[2, 3, 4], [-2, -4, 0], [1, 2], [1, 1, 1, 5, 6], [0, 9, 8, 7]]

##### Expected Output #####
# 9
# -6
# 3
# 14
# 24
