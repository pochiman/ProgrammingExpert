# Use a single for loop to iterate through the provided list of numbers, and for each number, print 
# the sum of the number and the one directly to its right. In other words, print lst[i] + lst[i + 1].

# Since the last number in the list has no number to the right of it, you should simply skip it.

# Provided List
lst = [-2, 0, 4, 5, 1, 2]

##### Expected Output #####
# -2
# 4
# 9
# 6
# 3
