# Key Term

# [Dictionary]
In Python, a `dictionary` (or `dict`) is a collection that associates immutable 
keys with values of any type. For example, the following code creates and accesses 
a dictionary that stores the age of each person according to their names:

`ages = {`
    `"Simon": 27,`
    `"Alex": 30,`
    `"Clement": 7,`
`}`
`print("Alex is", ages["Alex"], "years old")`
