# Key Term

# [Set]
`Sets` are collections of unique objects. In Python, you can create a new set with 
`my_set = set()`, add to it with `my_set.add(item)`, and remove items from it with 
`my_set.remove(item)`.

One important note about sets is that they are not ordered, so iterating through 
a set is not guaranteed to give you the same result every time.
