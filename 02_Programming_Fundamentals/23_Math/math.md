# Key Terms

# [Standard_Library]
The `standard library` of a language are the libraries that the language comes with by 
default. In Python, this includes modules like `os`, `math`, `threading` and many more.

# [math_Module]
The `math` module is part of the Python `standard library`, and gives you many nice 
functions that you may need to use in real world programs. For instance, `math.sin(x)`, 
`math.cos(x)`, `math.tan(x)` and `math.pi` are available from the `math` module.

# [random_Module]
The `random` module is part of the Python `standard library`, and provides many 
functions that you can use to generate random numbers or make random choices. 
`random.randint(start, stop)`, `random.randrange(start, stop, step)` and 
`random.choice(iterable)` are a few commonly used functions from the `random` module.
