# [Object]
In Python, `object` is the class that all other classes inherit from, even if it wasn't 
declared explicitly by the programmer. Almost everything in Python is an object, including 
`function`s, `list`s, `int`s and all other instances of built in data types. An object's 
type is defined by the class that was used to instantiate it. For example, the assignment 
`x = 1` creates a new object with type `int` containing the value `1`.

# [Class]
In programming, a `class` can be thought of as a template or blueprint for the creation of 
objects. The type of an object is the class that was used to create it. Classes define the 
attributes and methods (i.e. the behavior) of objects that are instantiated using them.
