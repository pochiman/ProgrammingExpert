# Key Terms

# [Attribute]
An `attribute` is an `object` that belongs either to a class, or to an instance 
of that class. Attributes of an object can be referenced using the `.` notation: 
`print(person.name)`.

`Class attributes` are attributes that are shared by all instances of that class, 
while `instance attributes` may have a different value for each and every instance 
that was created.  

# [Constructor]
The `constructor` of a class is a function defined within the class definition 
that will be called when a new instance is created. In Python, the `constructor` 
is implemented with the `__init__` method.

Typically, the `constructor` is responsible for initializing any instance variables, 
and essentially prepares the instance for use by the rest of the program.

# [Instance]
An `instance` of a class is an object created from that class' "blueprint". 
For example, `Person("Tim")` will return an `instance` of the `Person` class.

# [Encapsulation]
Encapsulation in `Object Oriented Programming` refers to how a programmer might 
prevent outside access to the details of a class in order to simplify the way 
the class might be used, or to make it harder to misuse the functionality that 
is exposed through certain methods or properties.
