# Key Terms

# [Child_Class]
When a class `A` inherits from class `B`, we say that class `A` is a `child class` of `B`.

# [Parent_Class]
When a class `A` inherits from class `B`, we say that class `B` is a `parent class` of `A`.

# [Polymorphism]
`Polymorphism` is a term originating from biology, where poly means many and morphism means 
forms (this is a simplification). In programming, polymorphism refers to the ability for an 
object to behave in different ways and exhibit different behavior based on the context it's 
used in.

# [Method_Overriding]
Method `overriding` is when a programmer redefines a method on a class that was already 
defined in its `parent class(es)`.
