# [Abstract_Method]
An `abstract method` is a method that is defined in an interface or abstract class and 
does not provide an implementation. Abstract methods are designed to be overriden by 
base or subclasses that extend the class or implement the interface they're defined in.

# [Abstract_Class]
An `abstract class` is a class that contains at least one abstract method and is not 
meant to be instantiated. Abstract classes are meant to act as the parent or base class 
in an inheritance hierarchy. Typically, abstract classes implement some functionality 
that can be used commonly by all child or subclasses.
