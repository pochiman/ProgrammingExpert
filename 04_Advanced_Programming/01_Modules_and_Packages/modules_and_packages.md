# Key Terms

# [Main_Module]
In Python, the `main` module is the one that is invoked or run directly. Python will 
automatically set the `__name__` variable of that module to the string `"__main__"`. 
All modules that are imported from that main package will have their own values for 
the `__name__` variable.

When writing your modules in Python, it is best practice to run some parts of the code 
conditionally based on that `__name__` variable:

`if __name__ == "__main__":`
    `print("This code will only run if this is the main package!")`

# [Module]
In Python, a `module` is simply any Python file (something ending in `.py`). Modules 
provide a way to split code into multiple files and make programs easier to understand. 
One Python module is able to import code from another Python module.

# [Package]
A Python `package` is simply a directory that contains a special file named `__init__.py`, 
and typically a collection of other Python modules. Packages provide a way to organize 
Python modules. When importing a Python package, the code inside of the `__init__.py` file 
will run once.
