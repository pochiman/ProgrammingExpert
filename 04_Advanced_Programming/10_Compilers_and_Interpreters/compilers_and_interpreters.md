# Key Terms

# [Compiler]
A `compiler` is a program that takes in source code (the code that we, humans, write) 
and transforms it into code that a machine can interpret (bytecode) or execute (binary code).

# [Interpreter]
An `interpreter` is a program that is capable of translating code (typically bytecode) into 
machine code that can be ran and executed by the CPU (central processing unit). Python code 
is first compiled into bytecode, that bytecode is then passed to the interpreter where it is 
interpreted and executed.

# [Source_Code]
The `source code` is the code that the programmers write and read.

# [Bytecode]
`Bytecode` is program code that has been compiled from source code into a lower level language 
that can be understood by an interpreter.
