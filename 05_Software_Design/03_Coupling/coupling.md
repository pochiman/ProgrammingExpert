# Key Term

# [Coupling]
`Coupling` refers to the degree of interdependence between things. In programming, it 
is typically desirable to reduce coupling. There are many different types of coupling:

 • `Content`: a component secretly modifies the internal data of another component.
 • `Stamp`: an argument type of a method is an application class.
 • `Routine Call`: a routine calling another routine.
 • `Type Use`: use of globally defined data types.
 • `Inclusion/Import`: importing unnecessary components. 
 • `External`: a dependency on something outside of the scope of the system like an 
    operating system, shared library, hardware, etc.
