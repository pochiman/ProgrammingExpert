# [Obsolescence]
`Obsolescence` refers to the process of becoming obsolete. In programming, something 
may become obsolete if it is no longer maintained, supported, documented or becomes 
outdated. It is desirable to avoid obsolescence when choosing libraries, languages, 
hardware and other technologies to be used in an application or project.
