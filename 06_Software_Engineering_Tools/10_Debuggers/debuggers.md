# Key Term

# [Debugging]
The act of `debugging` refers to when programmers look for and fix issues in their code 
that caused their programs to misbehave. 

A lot of the time, programmers edit their code to print out the value of their variables 
at key points of the program and pinpoint exactly where the error lies.
