# [Version_Control]
Version Control Systems (a.k.a.`VCS`) allow teams of developers to record changes that 
they make to their codebase. This also lets them revert changes that caused bugs, and 
prevent issues when multiple people on the team edit the same files at the same time.

`Git` is the most commonly used version control system, and is used by the overwhelming 
majority of software enterprises in the world.
