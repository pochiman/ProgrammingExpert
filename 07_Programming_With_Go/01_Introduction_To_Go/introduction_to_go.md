# Key Terms

# [Static_Typing]
A `statically typed` language requires the programmer to specify the type of each 
variable, either explicitly or implicitly (using something like the `:=` operator 
in Go). These types are then checked by the compiler before the code is executed. 
This typically results in less run-time errors as many typing errors are caught at 
compile time. Go is an example of a statically typed language.

# [Dynamic_Typing]
A `dynamically typed` language does not require the programmer to specify the types 
of their variables. This is because most type checking is done at run-time, as opposed 
to compile time. Dynamically typed languages are usually more flexible and allow for 
variables to change the types they store throughout the program. However, dynamically 
typed languages are prone to more run-time errors and can often be difficult to debug. 
Python is an example of a dynamically typed language.
