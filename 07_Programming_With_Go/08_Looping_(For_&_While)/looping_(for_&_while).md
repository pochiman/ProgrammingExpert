# Key Terms

# [ASCII]
`ASCII` is the abbreviation for `American Standard Code for Information Interchange`. 
This code provides a standard character set for computers where each character on the 
keyboard is represented by a unique integer.

In Python, you can determine the ASCII code for a character by using the `ord()` 
function and determine the character represented by an integer with the `chr()` 
function. For example, `ord('a')` returns `97` and `chr(97)` returns `a`.

# [UTF-8]
`UTF-8` stands for `Unicode Transformation Format 8-Bit` and is a character encoding 
format widely used on the internet. UTF-8 was designed to extend the older ASCII 
format and allow for encodings of text containing emojis, Chinese characters and 
other unique symbols that cannot be represented with ASCII.
