# [Goroutine]
A `goroutine` is a lightweight thread of execution that is managed by the Go runtime. 
To implement concurrency in Go, you can create a goroutine by writing `go functionToRunConcurrently()`. 
Go routines are much cheaper than running traditional threads and allow for concurrent execution 
of multiple pieces of code at the same time.
